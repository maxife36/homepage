### <p style="color:#6B8E23;">My Introduction to the IT World</p>

Thanks to my brother who is a backend developer, he introduced me to the IT world. I started to study in a self-taught way and with his guidance I was able to advance quickly. I found in programming an incredible world that I am really passionate about. I can be developing and studying for hours without noticing the passage of time because I do it because I like it. 

I have a strong passion for automating processes and solving complex problems. My focus is on developing solutions that are efficient, scalable, and robust, ensuring long-term effectiveness and adaptability.

Although I have more aptitude for backend development, once I started studying and practicing frontend development, I developed a special taste for visualizing what I develop and the infinite possibilities to improve the user experience (UX).
